[### Multi-Class Text Classification: A Comparison of Modelling vs. Clustering](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/blob/987c37729392529835f89ee6313a685366f37ca5/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification.ipynb):

Using a combination of Tf-IDF Vectorizers with clustering and supervised learning techniques to classify classical books by author. Here, I compare the performance of multiple models and clustering algorithms to determine which model classify texts with the highest accuracy.
