  [Multi-Class Text Classification: A Comparison of Modelling vs. Clustering](https://github.com/ayan1995/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/4d8e7a2c116808c170252503f910f7f79d09e179/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification.ipynb):
  Using a combination of Tf-IDF Vectorizers with clustering and supervised learning techniques to classify classical books by author. Here, I compare the performance of multiple models and clustering algorithms to determine which model classify texts witht eh highest accuracy.
