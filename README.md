## Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
  [Predicting Student Attendance and Analyzing Influencing Factors at New York Public Schools](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/blob/cba347d8735605850eb251aba12c9453c528adf1/Passnyc%20Predicting%20Attendance/Passnyc%20Predicting%20Attendance.ipynb):
  Using supervised learning models to predict student attendance rate at public schools in New York and then classifying schools that require external support. This investigation helps PASSNYC (non-profit organization) target schools for funding after-school programs and other resources to support the community.
  
### Natural Language Processing
  [Multi-Class Text Classification: A Comparison of Modelling vs. Clustering](https://github.com/ayan1995/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/4d8e7a2c116808c170252503f910f7f79d09e179/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification.ipynb):
  Using a combination of Tf-IDF Vectorizers with clustering and supervised learning techniques to classify classical books by author. Here, I compare the performance of multiple models and clustering algorithms to determine which model classify texts with the highest accuracy.
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis
  [Cryptocurrency Market Exploration](https://github.com/ayan1995/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/94ed33812c8b1bf1293a96f5087a0fc762805074/CryptoCurrency%20Data%20Exploration/Ayan%20Karim%20Cryptocurrency%20Capstone.ipynb): Exploring trends and relationships in cryptocurrency using historic market data to gain insight on common characteristics amongst popular cryptos for the sake of future research.
