### Opinion Mining
  [Opinion Mining: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/tree/master/Opinion%20Mining):
  "Opinion Mining" is one of the most useful applications of Data Science in which a pipeline is designed to process and interpret public opinion about various products. The source of this data usually comes from public sources like reviews, article and social media so that the company can gain a diverse understanding of how people feel about their products.

My endeavor with this project is to create a pipeline that solves this problem. So, I developed a Data Science product that collects information from the web, that processes and models the text data, and finally gives an end-user a summary of sentiments concerning their product which they can then use for product development. To take it a step further, this pipeline also applies the same process to another product that's in competition. For the sake of my demo, my target product is an iPhone X, and I compare it to Samsung's Galaxy S9.

### Natural Language Processing
  [Multi-Class Text Classification: A Comparison of Modelling vs. Clustering](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/blob/cba347d8735605850eb251aba12c9453c528adf1/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification/Multi-Class%20Text%20Classification.ipynb):
  Using a combination of Tf-IDF Vectorizers with clustering and supervised learning techniques to classify classical books by author. Here, I compare the performance of multiple models and clustering algorithms to determine which model classify texts with the highest accuracy.

### Supervised Learning
  [Predicting Student Attendance and Analyzing Influencing Factors at New York Public Schools](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/blob/cba347d8735605850eb251aba12c9453c528adf1/Passnyc%20Predicting%20Attendance/Passnyc%20Predicting%20Attendance.ipynb):
  Using supervised learning models to predict student attendance rate at public schools in New York and then classifying schools that require external support. This investigation helps PASSNYC (non-profit organization) target schools for funding after-school programs and other resources to support the community.
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis
  [Cryptocurrency Market Exploration](https://github.com/ayan1995/DataDriven/blob/cba347d8735605850eb251aba12c9453c528adf1/CryptoCurrency%20Data%20Exploration/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Exploration%20%20by%20Ayan%20Karim.ipynb): Exploring trends and relationships in cryptocurrency using historic market data to gain insight on common characteristics amongst popular cryptos for the sake of future research.
